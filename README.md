**Deployment Status :** [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8cead927-4291-4040-8d83-e11d800392ff/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/amazing-varahamihira-e498d6/deploys)

## Josephdrane.com built w/ gatsbyjs

**My Experienc and Thoughtse**
- can't use github pages when you need an env api key
- netlify is pretty easy to setup
- site feels pretty fast which is nice
- the way graphql is done looks pretty good
- need to try out how we do client side routing in gatsby
- npm install of gatsby globally resulted in permissions errors, had to fix those (I'm on a Mac)
- netlify is running `gatsby build` and the folder provided is the public/ folder here.
- if you want to use this, you'll have to test by creating a `.env` file to have the process.env variables being looked for in here.
